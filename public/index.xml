      <description>This is the first post of this blog. Not much here, just moving from medium publications to hugo. Honestly, I just have like 3 posts there which are all before this intro. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this goes&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;ve also contributed a bit at Scotch.io
A little something from one of my favorite speakers, Peter Bourgon on one of his talks Evolutionary Optimization with Go

      <description>I’m a developer by day, and mostly curious the rest of the time. I recently got the Philips Hue Starter Kit 3rd Generation (See Review Here), got the Hue Disco app, and raved on my own before I was quickly bored. So I decided to see how else I could use the bulbs.
Can I change the color on my own… 🤔 Turns out, there’s extensive APIs and SDKS for the Hue Lights.</description>

      <title>Quicker Angular Forms Validation</title>

      <description>The community is moving away from calling Angular by version names, Angular 2, Angular 4 and the likes. It’s now just Angular, mainly because of the clear 6 months release cycles recently mentioned.
So in light of this, I updated my Open Source Project, angular validators, to ng-validators. I was surprised that name was available, because there are a couple of validators out there, you can pick whichever you want.</description>

      <description>I’ve always just read about docker, for almost a year now, and recently decided to move all my development workflow to docker. I’ll briefly write about how I did this for two of the recent projects I’ve been working on, a mean stack application, and a Laravel-Postgres application.
I’m set up on a mac, and since docker is not natively supported on mac and Windows unless you have Virtual Box installed, I joined the docker beta program.</description>
