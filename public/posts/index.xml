      <title>Tinkering with Philips Hue Lights</title>

      <description>Iâ€™m a developer by day, and mostly curious the rest of the time. I recently got the Philips Hue Starter Kit 3rd Generation (See Review Here), got the Hue Disco app, and raved on my own before I was quickly bored. So I decided to see how else I could use the bulbs.
Can I change the color on my ownâ€¦ ðŸ¤” Turns out, thereâ€™s extensive APIs and SDKS for the Hue Lights.</description>

      <title>Quicker Angular Forms Validation</title>

      <description>The community is moving away from calling Angular by version names, Angular 2, Angular 4 and the likes. Itâ€™s now just Angular, mainly because of the clear 6 months release cycles recently mentioned.
So in light of this, I updated my Open Source Project, angular validators, to ng-validators. I was surprised that name was available, because there are a couple of validators out there, you can pick whichever you want.</description>

      <title>Dockerizing My Dev Workflow</title>

      <description>Iâ€™ve always just read about docker, for almost a year now, and recently decided to move all my development workflow to docker. Iâ€™ll briefly write about how I did this for two of the recent projects Iâ€™ve been working on, a mean stack application, and a Laravel-Postgres application.
Iâ€™m set up on a mac, and since docker is not natively supported on mac and Windows unless you have Virtual Box installed, I joined the docker beta program.</description>
